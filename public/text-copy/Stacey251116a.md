Hi Stacy,

A week at Crafted, wrapped in light,
 You made Alys feel just *so* right.
 From first warm welcome, smile so true,
 The magic of the week was *you*.

You opened doors and hearts with grace,
 Gave us a front-row seat to place.
 Each sip and story, every show,
 Meant more than you could ever know.

Firkin Fête and soiree glow,
 The Makers Market’s gentle flow,
 Behind it all, your steady hand,
 Crafting moments, shaping brand.

Your marketer’s mind, your host’s warm art,
 Somehow speak right to the heart.
 You made the schedule, crowds, and pace
 Still feel like time in sacred space.

You welcomed us with such sweet grace,
 A VIP embrace in every space.
 The stay, the care, the thoughtful touch—
 You made us feel like we mattered *so* much.

We leave inspired, and grateful too,
 For Crafted, Alys, and for you.
 If ever we can help or share,
 Just say the word — we’ll *be* there.

With deep appreciation,

Deven & Nancy Jo
